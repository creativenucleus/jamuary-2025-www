# What is This?

ByteJamming is livecoding on [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/). It's casual and creative, with a friendly community.

[Field-FX](https://mastodon.social/@FieldFX@mastodon.online) aims to run Monday Night Bytes every week - an online stream. 

Effects made in ByteJams are archived on [DemoZoo](https://livecode.demozoo.org/type/Byte_Jam.html#mc)
