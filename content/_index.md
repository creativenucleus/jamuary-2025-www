# What is This?

ByteJamming is livecoding on [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) - that's making visual effects while people watch.

[Field-FX](https://mastodon.social/@FieldFX@mastodon.online) aims to run Monday Night Bytes every week - it's an online stream, with (usually) four or more coders, making something - often with a live DJ.

I've been doing ByteJams since Feb 2023. It's casual and creative, with a friendly and supportive community. My first time was scary, but they now *mostly* feel relaxed - and I think it's a lovely way to experiment, make art, and often hit a 'flow' state of mind. It's also a great way to appreciate what others can do, and learn from them.

Everyone has their own style and their own tricks. I'd like to share mine, with two goals:

1) I'd like to encourage anyone who is thinking about trying a ByteJam to do so. I'll give you some suggestions for code that will help you more confidently make something fancy. (If you'd like to try a ByteJam and would like some help getting on-boarded, drop me a message).

2) If you're more experienced, I hope you'll find at least a couple of tips within the month's tips that you can adapt, to expand the range of things you can make. (Maybe we can share your tips too?).

So - ByteJamuary will be one trick every day of January 2025. They'll all be very short, but with lots of scope for you to play.

I'll start one day early, on 31st December, just to get an introduction out of the way, but the rest of the tips should be practical. I'll aim not to duplicate too much from the brilliant [Tiny Code Christmas](https://tcc.lovebyte.party/).
