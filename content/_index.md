description: A Month of Daily ByteJam Tricks

# What is This?

ByteJamming is livecoding on [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/). Making visual effects while people watch.

[Field-FX](https://mastodon.social/@FieldFX@mastodon.online) aims to run Monday Night Bytes every week - it's an online stream, with (usually) four or more coders, making something - often with a live DJ mix.

I've been doing ByteJams since Feb 2024. It's casual and creative, with a friendly and supportive community. My first time was scary, but they now mostly feel relaxed - and I think it's a lovely way to experiment, make art, and often hit a 'flow' state of mind. It's also a great way to appreciate what others can do, and learn from them.

Everyone has their own style and their own tricks. I'd like to share mine, with two goals:

1) I'd like to encourage anyone who is thinking about trying a ByteJam to do so. I'll give you some suggestions for code that will help you more confidently make something fancy.

2) If you're more experienced, I hope you'll find at least a couple of things in the month to adapt, to expand the range of things you can use!

So - ByteJamuary will be one trick every day of January 2025. I'll start one day early, on 31st December, just to get an introduction out of the way. The rest of the tips should be practical.
